# The-Gaming-Room

#### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
Our client, The Gaming Room, wanted our company, Creative Technology Solutions (CTS), to develop a web-based game for multiple platforms of the their current game, "Draw It Or Lose It," which is currently only available on Android. The game is similar to the 1980's game show "Win, Lose, or Draw" in which teams guess what image is being drawn. 

#### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
After reviewing the mistakes I made with the Project One Milestone, I believe I did well on the executive summary, design constraints, and the system architecture view. 

#### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I found The Gaming Room UML diagram to be the most helpful once I fully understood the sturcture of UML diagrams. I was confused by them at first due to the amount of "Gang of Four" models and I know I still need more practice with them, but the visualization of the UML diagram in this documentation made it a lot easier to understand the code.

#### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the evaluation table by providing a better explanation of the pros and cons of each platform under the different categories. I revised this from my first submission, but I'm still not sure if it is as good as it can be.

#### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by analyzing The Gaming Room's requirements and approached the design of the software based on how the user would interact with the software itself. The design constraints were essentially "needs" that would ensure that the user experience would be optimal. The domain model helped to create and organized and effienct application that would also ensure tha the user would have the best experience possible. It's always important to consider the user's needs when designing software because they are what will make the software successful to the client. If the user experience is not good, then it is less likely that they will use it, thus hurting the client that has paid us to do a good job. 

#### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing software by breaking down the client's requirements and considering about the user experience. At first, the client's requirements are usually vague and broad, so it falls on the development team to help make a more sensible and organized application. Breaking down the braod requirments and thinking about the best ways to fulfill them is essentially what developers need to do in order to build functioning applications. The user experience is just as important as the applications functionality, so thinking about this can make the design process more focused. This is how I plan to design software moving forward in my career.
